                    The literary intensity with which Kafka portrayed his sense of physical malady is characteristic of his writing in his diaries,
                    which he kept between 1909 and 1923.

                <p>
                    On 9 October 1911, Franz Kafka, then 28 years old, wrote in his diary that he didnâ€™t expect to reach the age of 40. At the time of this entry, he was not yet stricken with the tuberculosis that would lead to his death in 1924, shortly before his 41st birthday.
                    What afflicted him at that time, making him doubt his longevity.
